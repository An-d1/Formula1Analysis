# Formula 1 Race Analysis Tool

This project will try to analyse as best as possible different aspects of an specific f1 race.
- The beauty of it is that it is not bounded to a finite set of races, but can take as parameters from the user all the possible 'Grand Prix' that fastf1 contains in it's data set,
- thus making it scalable and dynamic on users needs.
